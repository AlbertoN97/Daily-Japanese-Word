# Daily-Japanese-Word
Daily Japanese Word is a web server made using Flask on Python that prompts a different word every day, with its wrinting, pronunciation in hiragana and its meaning. Its implemented in a way that you can adjust word to your japanese level. For example, if you don't know all hiragana characters, you can adjust the daily word reading in order to only get those word you can already read.
